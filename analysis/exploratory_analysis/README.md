**You will find main figures and comments in the following Google Drive:

## Folders


* **cancer_analysis** -
In this folder you will find all notebooks linked to Pan-Cancer analysis: cancer panels, Genome Instability plots.
  * `cancer_panel.ipynb`: Code to create the cancer panels
  * `GI_pancancer_plot.ipynb`: Creation of Genome Instability plots
  * `hotspot_analysis.ipynb`: Pan-Cancer Hotspot Analysis
  * `TMB_pancancer.ipynb`: Tumor Mutational Burden Analysis
  

* **metrics_analysis** -
In this folder you will find notebooks used to compute metric panels ie panels that shows a unique metrics for all cancers (for example group proportion across all cancers).
  * `no_wgd_proportions.ipynb`: metric panels for Non WGD Cohort
  * `wgd_proportions.ipynb`: metric panels for WGD Cohort
  
  The metric panels are stored in the following folders:
    * **metrics_summaries_no_wgd**
    * **metrics_summaries_wgd**
  

* **cancer_exploration**
In this folder, you will find specific cancer explorations. You have 2 cancer categories:
  * **textbook_cases**: Cancers that show the best signal
  * **outliers**: Cancers that show an outlying signal


## Notebooks

* `data_clean_up.ipynb`: Determination of the right purity threshold to cut Non-WGD Cohort (this cut is done in **dataframe_generation** folder)
* `group_exploration.ipynb`: creation of the subgroups and general investigations
* `metrics_exploration.ipynb`:
